# vim-smartinput

this is a fork from [kana/vim-smartinput](https://github.com/kana/vim-smartinput) which has stopped updating since 2012.

I have some problems with this plugin so probably it's better to fix it myself.

a problem is, `syntax` for the rules is broken -- for some reason, the detection code from the original author 
cann't detect the syntax elements properly.
